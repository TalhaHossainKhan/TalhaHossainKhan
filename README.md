# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Talha

## About Me

I am an aspiring entrepreneur and a computer engineering major at the University of Maryland. I am passionate about technology and innovation. I'm focused on applying engineering knowledge to solve real-world problems, particularly in AI, IoT, and blockchain.

## Vision & Current Focus

My goal is to create a tech startup that revolutionizes the fintech industry. I'm exploring blockchain's potential in fintech, especially for developing countries. This interest stems from my work with the Youth Policy Forum in Bangladesh, advocating for pro-blockchain policies.

I'm developing a concept for a blockchain-based banking platform aimed at:
+ Providing microfinance
+ Connecting lenders and borrowers
+ Implementing digital identity verification
+ Enabling cross-border payments with local currency-pegged stablecoins
+ Offering investment and savings opportunities

## Let's Connect!
